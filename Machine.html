<h2>Machine Building</h2>

<p><a href="http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/embedded_programming/index.html">This weeks class</a> of Fab Academy 2015 was about machine building. This is the team building week and requires all of the members of the lab to come together to make something great. </p>

<p>To quote Neil Gershenfeld and Nadya Peek
Stress is press, Strain is Pain. &#8230; Given this machine that you guys are going to be building we already made some assumptions.</p>

<h2>The Machine</h2>

<p><a href="http://fablabcascina.org/">Fab Lab Cascina</a> is famous for people getting married, so we decided to make or very own amazing ring milling machine.<br>

My job is the electronics for controlling the stepper motors. All of my files can be found in the project repository <a href="https://github.com/ifala/m2m_ring/tree/master/Electronics">m2m_ring/Electronics.</a></p>

<h2>The Electronics</h2>

<p>I am located in the Netherlands which is a long way from Pisa so my fob was the electronics design. After a brain storming meeting with Fiore we decided to use the <a href="https://www.pololu.com/product/1182">Pololu - A4988 Stepper Motor Driver Carrier</a> breakout because it has adjustable current limiting, over-current and over-temperature protection, and different step resolutions. These use the <a href="https://www.pololu.com/file/download/A4988.pdf?file_id=0J450">A4988 and here is it&#8217;s datasheet</a>. This was not a chance choice. I recently finished creating a stepper control board from scratch and they are very delicate. I fried one of the A4988 drivers the third time I turned it on. (Blue smoke of death style.) There is a new, profound, appreciation for the Electronic Engineers in my life. I started with the motor stepper board I created for my final project and modified it for the machine that we are all building together. </p>

<p> Like so many components the Pololu - A4988 does not exist in any library so I had to fake it real.  8 pin headers were the key and I'll have to manually check the spacing in illustrator later.  I had to spin it a few ways buy I found a really nice position for it on the layout.  Everything else was a cakewalk except  the regulator.  The REG Ldo 5V 1A SOT223 [LM2940IMP-5.0CT-ND](http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/LM2940IMP-5.0/LM2940IMP-5.0CT-ND/3701581) that we used is a very tricky little component.  As you'll see in the datasheet [LM2940(-N, C)](http://media.digikey.com/pdf/Data%20Sheets/Texas%20Instruments%20PDFs/LM2940(-N,C)_Sept-23-2013.pdf) the input and output are exactly opposite of the regulator that is in the eagle library.  No fear,  I've seen this before.  Never trust a regulator, go read the datasheet. If you download the eagle file the component may seem backwards, but there is a reason for that.  In the upper right hand corner I left the circuit for the ESP8266, If we want to make the M2M wireless one day the circuit is all ready to go.  I uploaded all the files and emailed my group mates.  I hope our M2M machine is amazing.
