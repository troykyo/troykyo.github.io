##Electronics Design
[This weeks class](http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/electronics_design/index.html) of Fab Academy 2015 was about the Design of PCB's using different design software.  This week is a design oriented and demonstrates design skills and attitudes. 

To quote Prof Niel Gershenfeld

>"These have been evolving, they started from essentially toys and they're becoming quite substantial." 

My plan:

* Day 1 - Eagle
* Day 2 - Other design software
* Day 3 -  Simulation


###Eagle
We started with a schematic of Niels ![hello.ftdi.44](http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/embedded_programming/hello.ftdi.44.png)
Fiore made a great ["How to use Eagle tutorial"](https://vimeo.com/120501993) in Italian, which made the process fairly easy.  I did get stuck for about an hour in the board view trying to discover a way to understand which pads correspond to the nets on the schematic.  Info Properties is the solution. 
My first try was actually wrong.  I went with pull-down instead of pull-up (note the button going to VCC).   

This was a great chance to remake the circuit and learn Eagle better.  I re-made the circuit and was about to add the LED and Button, when I realized they were stuck.  I don't know if it is a problem with locked layers, grouped objects or something else.  I sought help from the internet, my Guru instructor and my friends who are electronic engineers.  No solution found I gave up and tried 123D Circuits which is documented bellow.  I came back a day later and redesigned from the beginning.  It finally worked, with no problems.  I did notice problems in aliasing in the curves I designed, so I returned to the board layout and chamfered the corners is a 45* bevel. 

Three times I tried to load my design as a png into [Fab Modules](http://fabmodules.org/) and three times I was unable to create a design that has appropriate clearance using a 1/64th milling bit.  I have an appointment with my Instructor for help and will update as soon as I figure out what it was.   
 Neil Gershenfeld is right; this has a high learning curve, but it becomes easier with use.  

##123D Circuits

I also wanted to try [123D Circuits](http://123d.circuits.io/) due to it's simulation capabilities.  The libraries were hard to understand, but the layout was fairly simple.  Strangely using GND and VCC as defined symbols didn't seem to work so I had to route them all manually.  This caused a big mess.  I forked my project went back and carefully detailed VCC and GND.  

Everything worked this time around.  Once I finally had resolved a few spacing problems and had a feel for how the rats nest is created / untangled all went well. 

I was disappointed to discover that [123D Circuits](http://123d.circuits.io/)  does not simulate circuits made in Schematic mode.  I attempted to remake the circuit on a virtual breadboard.  The Attiny 45 is not available and the Attiny 44 didn't work.  I couldn't find any similar examples that functioned.  

123d Circuits only exports as Gerber files which should work with our Roland mills, but I was unable to load it.  It was interesting that [123D Circuits](http://123d.circuits.io/) can auto-generate  a 3D printable case in [OpenJSCAD](http://openjscad.org/#) . Again, I will sit down with Guru master [Fiore Basile](https://github.com/fibasile) and work this out.  

##Conclusions

This week was interesting and frustrating.  Eagle is definitely the most full featured and production friendly program that I tried.  I did like 123D Circuits in that it gave me gerber files, but simulation was disappointing.  

Neither was produceable, but I will update after working with Fiore.
