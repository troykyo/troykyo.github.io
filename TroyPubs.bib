   abstract = {New research work (2012), Light-emitting Paper Strips was represented as part of a collaborative publication, E-Textile Swatch Exchange Swatchbook 2013 for the international exhibition, Exemplary: 150 Years of the MAK from Arts and Crafts to Design,  Austrian Museum of Applied Arts / Contemporary Art (MAK), Vienna. The exhibition showcased an inspiring juxtaposition between the tradition-steeped MAK Collection and contemporary avant-garde design. 

The swatchbook is a platform for sharing physical work samples in the field of electronic textiles. The collection of samples were produced by 24 individuals with diverse links to the international etextile community, including academic researchers, textile designers, industrial designers, artists, electrical engineers and enthusiastic makers. 

The exchange of samples emphasizes the importance of physicality and quality workmanship in an increasingly digital world. Individuals and collaborative efforts participate in the exchange by submitting a unique swatch design of their own, and in turn receive a compiled collection of everybody elseâ€™s swatches. 

Light-emitting Paper Strips was based on research findings from a Creative Scotland ConTEXT Artist in Residency award, Heriot-Watt University and a Creative Scotland Craft Maker Award (2012).

The Swatchbook was also selected for the International Symposium of Wearable Computers, 2014 Design Exhibition, EMP Museum Seattle, USA.

   abstract = {In this article, we describe the design of a program that allows users to create their personal shoe soles. The program has a backend which generates different components of the sole, such as the treads, the sur-face, the insole pattern and the contour (where the sole will be connected to the rest of the shoe). Instead of the traditio-nal fixed grids, we use Voronoi diagrams, which have another aesthetic appeal and which allow influ-encing the dynamic behavior of the sole. This program shows an example of the possibilities of digital fabrica-tion (3D printing) for the personalization of material properties and behavior when combined with mathematical algorithms. Moreover, we highlight our approach and interesting algorithmic aspects like intersecting edges and contours, generating Voronoi diagrams, finding polygons, solving the Chinese postman problem, and solving the travelling salesman problem. 1 Background and vision We envision future product service systems where the user has more influence on the products he or she pur-chases and plays a role in the programming of the material. The primary technological enablers for this change are twofold: first the advent and widespread application of digital manufacturing equipment which may gradual-ly replace the traditional manufacturing equipment. In traditional manufacturing, there is one expensive mold or one machine setup, or one human drill, which is prepared once and then executed many times. The efficiency of this type of manufacturing demands that there are large numbers of the same products which are produced in large batches. With digital manufactur-ing, one machine can produce a huge variety of designs without mold making, training or machine reconfigura-tion. Examples are digital printers, digital embroidery machines, CNC milling machines, and of course 3D print-ers. At present, traditional manufacturing can still provide better quality at lower cost, but as additive manufac-turing improves quickly, the vision of the users personalizing products gains feasibility. The second technologi-cal enabler is the Internet, which allows any user to create, share and manage digital information. There are other enablers as well, such as changes in logistics chains. Web shops with online payments and fast delivery services are getting very common.},

When applied to interaction design in the near field the garments that people wear can become an interface or expression for sensing and actuating.

   abstract = {In this paper three separate approaches to recording use data are encompassed in a single shoe sole prototype. A shoe sole with electronic and nonelectronic sensors is crafted using 3D printing of flexible materials from programed g-Code. The sole is inserted into a laser cut, 3D printing reinforced shoe upper. The shoe and sole are constructed from a design process of "Prototyping as a vehicle for inquiry" [7]. The idea of slow technology is applied during the inquiry and new methods of non-electronic sensing are developed. The first approach uses flexible, conductive 3D printed material to construct pressure sensors in the shoe sole. The second approach uses photographic analysis and material color change to determine use over time. The third method creates micro geometric structures via code that are intended to break in specific ways with specific use. Although many hours are spent developing these approaches, the shoe serves as a research archetype that attempts to asks questions about precision, design and sustainability.},

An extra dimension was added to the classification of research methods pertaining to the Research Domains, in order to provide a more insightful overview of the field. An analysis of the research methods and purposes, and domains of ISWC is presented. Additionally, the citation impact of ISWC publications is evaluated and compared over these dimensions.

   abstract = {In this case study three designers supported by multiple stakeholders created a pair of fully personalized printed high heel shoes in a period of two months for a single user. The shoes are made with soft and flexible materials for dynamic fit and use. The shoes are not only uniquely formed to the user's feet but the geometry of the material is designed to support and flex with the movement of each foot. These shoes utilize a 4D printing approach in the way they are made to fit the user while they move and change. Designing a shoe to such a degree represents a form of Ultra Personalization. This case study of an ultra personalized approach addresses the negotiation of key design considerations: aesthetics, comfort, robustness, balance and temperature. The findings inform digital fabrication design, software, and tools for designers.},

   abstract = {Â©2019 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s). Publication rights licensed to ACM. Personalization of shoes is of increasing importance to designers, researchers, shoemakers and manufacturers as mass customization progresses towards ultra-personalized product service systems. Many attempts have been made to design co-creation platforms that allow end users to personalize their own shoes. concentrating on color preference. This research takes a different approach by designing a toolkit for maker-oriented users to co-manufacture their own shoes. The toolkit was deployed worldwide to different users via crowdsharing. Backers (n=237) were surveyed before deployment and thirty users were interviewed after two years to understand personalization over a full cycle of making and use with the crafted research product. We found that users who have higher quality tools and materials in their toolkits are more likely to personalize their shoes while co-manufacturing. The research provides insights for researchers and designers creating toolkits for designing personalization product service systems/configurators and engaging in tangible bespoke processes.},

   abstract = {Design games are rarely used to design shoes but data and emerging digital fabrication systems are rapidly changing how designers make things. We envision a near future where shoes are personalised using algorithmic, parametric, and generative systems that are data-driven. In this article, we describe and deploy a design game for shoes to help designers create circular Ultra-Personalised Product Service System. Designing such products (that include services supported by systems that last over product lifetimes) presents a multitude of challenges; product challenges in negotiating design considerations, service challenges in customer journeys and systemic challenges in creating data flows. The UPPSS game was designed to help scaffold designers in confronting these challenges. The UPPSS game was deployed with 16 industrial design students over nine weeks where shoes, services, and systems were all made using code to program personalisation systems. Each participant wrote a reflection on the process. The reflections were analysed to see how the design game resulted in facing the challenges and learnings of a UPPSS. Conclusions are presented from the challenges and opportunities confronted in the game, and what it meant to the emerging practices of designing a UPPSS.},
